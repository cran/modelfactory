Description: Statisticians often want to compare the fit of different models on 
    the same data set. However, this usually involves a lot of manual code to 
    fish items out of summary() or plain model objects. 'modelfactory' offers 
    the capability to pass multiple models in and get out metrics or 
    coefficients for quick comparison with easy-to-remember syntax.
