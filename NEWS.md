# modelfactory 1.0.0

* Initial CRAN submission.

* This is my first R package! 

* Statisticians often want to compare different models fit to the same data set. However, this usually involves a lot of manual code to fish items out of summary() or plain model objects. 'modelfactory' offers the 
capability to pass multiple models in and get out metrics or coefficients for quick comparison with easy-to-remember syntax.

* New functions `stack_coeff()` and `stack_metrics()`. Please read more about these in the documentation!
